    "Recall the equation for a straight line $y = mx+c$, where $m$ denotes the slope and $c$ the intercept. Note, as you come to encounter linear regression, where $m$ and $c$ are unknown parameters to be determined from data, you will see $m$ typically replaced with $\\beta_1$ and $c$ with $\\beta_0$, where $\\beta_i$ denotes a parameter to be determined. Thus the straight line formula will be written $y = \\beta_1x + \\beta_0$ or $y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1x$. These two forms, of course, being mathematically equivalent."

Although the plot function is very useful for sequences, in our case here we have a sequence of points that all lie on a straight line. This means it will be impossible in a plain line plot to tell whether there is one straight line between two endpoints, or a series of points. It can be more informative to show the individual points, and so here we will use a scatter plot rather than a line plot."

    "Great! In these few simple examples, you've already come a long way. You're using a notebook to develop a sequence of data manipulations, which can include descriptive, formatted text. Although we won't be using numpy directly in this short course, we've seen how it provides data types and operations that allow us to succinctly perform data operations. This kind of convenience and succinctness is what makes python and its ecosystem a great choice for data science. Pandas, which we'll come to shortly, is built on top of numpy. We've also seen how we can add visualizations of our data to our notebook."
